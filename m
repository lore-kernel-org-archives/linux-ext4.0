I'm not sure we can make Linux xstat (or whatever) match AIX statxat() very
closely, at least from a syscall interface point of view.  We really need the
AT_* flags mask to be compatible with the other Linux syscalls and the length
parameter that I originally had got argued out of existence.  I would also
like to make it so that there aren't different 32-bit and 64-bit interfaces to
the kernel - though that means a burden on glibc/uClibc/etc., I guess.

I do also want to be able to pass a mask of what we're actually interested in
- but that's not part of the AIX interface.

I also like the idea of having a larger buffer with the ability to return
extra info (such as security label xattrs), but I was told it was a poor idea,
so that got taken out.
