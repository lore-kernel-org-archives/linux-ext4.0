Even though we can use leases (oplocks) to avoid the roundrtrip, it is
probably too expensive to default to forcing a cache flush, especially
when a common case is to get the file creation time or inode number
information (stable vs volatile).

Would it be better to make the stable vs volatile inode number an attribute
of the volume  or something returned by the proposed xstat?

Today I export these through an psuedo-xattr in cifs.ko, I am curious how
NTFS and FAT export these on linux.

Given the overlap in optional attributes between the network
protocol and local NTFS (and ReFS and to a lesser extent FAT)
I would expect cifs.ko and the ntfs implementations
info to map pretty closely.

You already have support for an indicator for offline files (HSM),
would XSTAT_INFO_OFFLINE be intended for the case
where the network session to the server is disconnected
(and in which you case the application does not want to reconnect)?
