Hi Andreas,

I'll probably have quite a few more comments on this page as I get to
understand RichACLs better. Here's some comments from an initial
reading.

So, an initial comment. It seems to me to that this page (but
not setrichacl(1) and getrichacl(1)) should ultimately land in
man-pages (just like acl(7)), since we're talking about a kernel
feature. Make sense?

=46or what it's worth, I think it would be worthwhile to start with
a consistent abbreviation comment here (and use it throughout all of th=
e
man pages): "RichACL" (or "richACL"), rather than "richacl"; that seems
more consistent with the traditional abbreviation "ACL".

Use
=2EBR setrichacl (1)
for cross-references.

Here, I think it would be helpful to add a sentence:

"An attempt to set a richacl that cannot be represented exactly by the
file permission bits results in an error."

(If that sentence is correct, of course.)

>=20
> .SH STRUCTURE OF RICHACLS

=46or all of the "nonstandard" (see man-pages(7)) ".SH" sections here, =
I'd
be inclined to switch to using ".SS" subsections. There are downsides t=
o
multiple nonstandard section headings (e.g., automated TOCs for
Section headings become clumsy and long), and I don't think your use of
=2ESH vs .SS really helps much to structure the information in this pag=
e.

I'd restructure the preceding sentence as:

"Unlike POSIX ACLs, richacls do not.... that define the inheritable
permissions."

I'd use lower case in the above for all words except the first.
(That's the convention in man-pages.)

s/4/8/ in the preceding two lines. I think more indentation would make
this (and the similar lists below) more readable.

> .B masked
> .RB ( m ):

I'd write each of these list entries starting here, and below, in the
form:

=2EBR masked "\ (" m ):

This form is a little easier to read in the source, and
it forces just a single space before the "(", which looks
a little better, I find.

So here, I think there should be a sentence that explains how a meaning
is attached to the strings? Is this for NFS, for Windows, for something
else?

Replace the preceding four lines by

=2EBR read_data / list_directory "\ (" r )

and do similar for the next two list entried below.
Note that "\ (" will force just a singlke space before the "(".

> Read the data of a file.
> List the contents of a directory.

In the above list entry, and the next two, I find the layout ("xxx/yyy =
(z)")
confusing. A closer reading indicates that in each case, the "xxx"
applies for files and he "yyy" is for directories. But I think the text
could make this point a little easier to grasp. In each of these three
list entries this could be done something lke the following:

"For a file: read the data of the file. For a directory: list the
contents of the directory."

By the way, can the terms "read_data" and "list_directory" be used
interchangeably? That is, can you employ (say) "read_data" when setting
an ACL entry for a directory? (I'm assuming the answer is "yes".)
If the terms are just interchangeable synonyms, perhas it's worth
making that point explicitly in the text.

> .HP

See above comment re file/directory.

> .HP
> .B append_data
> /
> .B add_subdirectory
> .RB ( p ):
> Open a file in append mode. Create a subdirectory in a directory.

So, in other words, if append mode is denied, then the file can be
opened for writing (contingent on write permission  being granted), but
can't be opened with O_APPEND? Is that correct? This point needs to be
made clearer.

> .HP

See above comment re file/directory.

What are "attributes" in this context? Does this mean stat(2)? Make thi=
s
explicit.

So, I thenk that a sentence here should explain why these permissions
exist. Is if for future extension, because they are meaningful in NFS,
or something else?

If you follow my suggestion about capitalization in the ".SS" entries,
you'll need to change the capitalization in the above phrases.

Use

for cross-reference.

Use
=2ERB ( chmod (1)).

creat(2) is pretty much history. I suggest writing

(as given to
=2EBR open (2),
=2EBR mkdir (2),
and similar).

And here, I think we need a statement about whether the process umask
has an effect or not...

will be set to

where
=2EI mode
is the permission mode argument of the relevant system call and
=2EI umask
is the process umask (see

I'm confused by the previous sentence. the feature is labeled "Automati=
c
Inheritance", implying that the user/process need do nothing. The next
sentence says "propagation ... is the responsibility of the process".
These two points seem contradictory. I think something more needs to be
said here.

This page is in *desperate* need of *multiple* examples, starting simpl=
e,
and building up in complexity, with walkthogh text explaining how the
permisssions are interpreted and how the masks are generated.
Having read the page multiple times (and having little knowledge
of NFS ACLs), I'm still struggling to put all the pieces together.
Probably some examples that relate to an NFS context would also be
helpful.
