Samba (e.g. winbind service) has mapping libraries for mapping SIDs to
UIDs (CIFS ACLs already have the same issue of SID to UID mapping
which we handle with upcalls) and Samba has various pluggable ways to
handle UID mapping and is easily extensible.  Similarly NFSv4 ACLs,
although closely related to CIFS/NTFS ACLs have to be map usernames to
uids.
