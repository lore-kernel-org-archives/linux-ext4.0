I think I should forget all things regarding LXC, just treat it as a new
quota feature with regard to namespace.

nothing now. :)

Yup, just treat it to be namespace specific, there is nothing need to
consider with cgroup interface.

I'll more investigation for that.

I have tried to keep quota files outsides originally, but I changed my
thoughts afterwards, because of three reasons at that time:

1) The quota files could be overwrote if the container's rootfs is
located at the root directory of a storage partition, and this partition
is mounted with quota limits enabled.

2) To deal with quota files, looks I have to tweak up
quota_read()/quota_write(), assuming ext4, which are corresponding to
ext4_quota_read()/ext4_quota_write().

3) As mount namespace could be created and destroyed at any stage,
it has no memory to recall which inodes are quota files. however, quota
tools need to restore a few things from those files I remember.
but can not recalled all of them for now. :( I'll do some check up to
refresh my head in this point.

Sure, considering that we can bind mount them at setup phase, the first
concern could be ignored.


Thanks,
-Jeff
