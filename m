I've been doing an audit of our direct I/O implementations, and most
of them does some form of transparent fallback, including some that
only pretend to support O_DIRECT, but do anything special for it at all,
while at the same time we go through greast efforts to check a file
system actualy supports direct I/O, leading to nasty no-op ->direct_IO
implementations as we even got that abstraction wrong.

At this point I wonder if we should simply treat O_DIRECT as a hint
and always allow it, and just let the file system optimize for it
(skip buffering, require alignment, relaxed Posix atomicy requirements)
if it is set.
