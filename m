Hi Andreas,

Here's a few more comments on the current richacl(7) page
that I fetched from the git repo.

Having read the following paragraph a number of times (and being
ignorant of NFS ACLs), I find that I'm none the wiser about what you ar=
e
trying to say. What does it mean to "apply a file mode to an... ACL"?
Likewise, how does "the file mode determine the values of the file
masks"? This isn't clear in the following paragraph, and doesn't seem t=
o
be alborated in the rest of the page. Could you add some text somehwere
to explain these points?

I think it might be helpful here to list which filesystems so far
support RichACLs.

Insert a blank line here, to start a new paragraph.

In the previous line you write "entity". In the lines below you use
"identifier". The terminology switch is confusing. Use just one
term.

Does this field have a name? It would make dicussing it easier
to give it a name. That is, an ACL entry consists of four fields:

* a tag
* permissions
* flags
* ??? ("type"?)

I don't think the heavy indentation here is helpful, and it narrors the
text considerably. I suggest replacing the preceding .RS+.HP with .TP,
and changing ewach .HP below to .TP, and remove the colon at the end of
each line that follows the .TP lines.

There needs to be a statement here about what 'write_through' does if
'masked' is not set.

What does "assigned by default" mean? That it was inherited because of
'dir_inherit' or 'file_inherit' in the pareent directory? This needs to
be clearer.

Maybe this would be better as:

"When this flag appears in the ACL entry of a directory, then that entr=
y is
inherited by new files created in the directory."

Is that text that I propose correct?

> .HP

"When this flag appears in the ACL entry of a directory, then that entr=
y is
inherited by new subdirectories created in the directory."

Is that text that I propose correct?

So, can this permission ever be taken away? If yes, say so. If not, why
does this permission exist? (And maybe say something about that.)

If you follow my .TP suggestion above, then the above lines would need
to be rewritten sometinh like:

=2EBR read_named_attrs "\ (" R "), " write_named_attrs "\ (" W "), " \
synchronize "\ (" S "), " write_retention "\ (" e "), " \
write_retention_hold "\ (" E )

I think the preceding sentence could be clearer. How about something
like the following (if correct):

[[
The who field is one of the following:

* One of the special identifiers: owner@, group@, or everyone@
* A user: or u: prefix followed by a [user name, user ID?] that designa=
tes
  s specific user
* A group: or g: prefix followed by a [group name, group ID?] that desi=
