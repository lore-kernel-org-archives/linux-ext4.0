Well ... you have to have an inode number on the Linux client side even=
 if
the server doesn't report them (or has a bug and reports duplicates).
If you can't tell hardlinked files apart fix the server (but in the
cases where the file systems has this problem the server doesn't usuall=
y
support hardlinks either).

If the server's file system internal structures don't support real inod=
e
numbers (such as FAT or a ramdisk) then it either has to make them
up based on something like path name or some other attribute of the
file on disk.

Servers like NetApp is where this gets interesting - for cifs e.g. leve=
l 1009
query file info is used to query_file_internal_info (the inode number) =
but
what if the server can not report inode numbers (due to a bug) in
all cases.
