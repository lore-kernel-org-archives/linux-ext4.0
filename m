You really need to update your xfsprogs install. You aren't testing
half of what you need to be testing if you are missing basic
functionality like fiemap support (which has been in xfs_io since
2011).

ANd if you don't have this user defined, then several quota tests
don't get run.

Ouch. There's another whole class of functionality you aren't
testing.

That's caused by having a very old xfs_io.

Can't say that I've seen that one fail for a long time. I can't say
anything useful about it, however, given how old your xfsprogs
installation is.

Your xfstests is not up to date. This is fixed by commit ee6ad7f
("xfs/049: umount -d fails when kernel wins teardown race").

Your xfsdump package is out of date and needs upgrading.

Same again.

You need to upgrade everything to current xfstests/xfsprogs/xfsdump
and retest *everything*. That means rerunning all your ext4 testing,
too, because you're not exercising all the cases where the
interesting accounting bugs lie (i.e. in fallocate operations).

I'd also suggest that you run the tests using MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o
pquota" after setting up default configurations for TEST_MNT and
SCRATCH_MNT so that you actually give the project quota code a
significant amount of work to do, and do the same for ext4,
otherwise you're not really testing it at all when you run xfstests
on ext4....

Cheers,

Dave.
