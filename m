Ummm...  No, my first attempt was definitely through getxattr().  You even
commented on it.

Fair enough.

I wonder if there's a way to make this explicit - or is it something that if
the bit isn't set, you can't use the value in st_blksize.  I wonder if this
value always has to be non-zero to make sure existing stat() doesn't explode.

True.
