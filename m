Instead of doing things this way, I've decided to clean things up by
updating the flags in uapi/linux/fs.h.  That's because some people who
might want to assign new flags might not be ext4 developers, and so
they wouldn't look at fs/ext4/ext4.h.

At the same time, we really don't want people adding new flags by
default, unless there is a really good reason.  So I've added a
comment making the history of the interface and suggesting that people
not assign new flags without thinking twice (or checking with
linux-fsdevel and linux-api).

    fs: clean up the flags definition in uapi/linux/fs.h
    
    Add an explanation for the flags used by FS_IOC_[GS]ETFLAGS and remind
    people that changes should be revised by linux-fsdevel and linux-api.
    
    Add flags that are used on-disk for ext4, and remove FS_DIRECTIO_FL
    since it was used only by gfs2 and support was removed in 2008 in
    commit c9f6a6bbc28 ("The ability to mark files for direct i/o access
    when opened normally is both unused and pointless, so this patch
    removes support for that feature.")  Now we have _two_ remaining flags
    left.  But since we want to discourage people from assigning new
    flags, that's OK.
