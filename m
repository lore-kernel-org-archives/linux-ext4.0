  As much as I understand your concerns I'm not convinced uevent interface
is a good fit. There are filesystems that don't have underlying block
device - think of e.g. tmpfs or filesystems working directly on top of
flash devices.  These still want to send notification to userspace (one of
primary motivation for this interfaces was so that tmpfs can notify about
something). And creating some fake nodes in /sys/block for tmpfs and
similar filesystems seems like doing more harm than good to me...
