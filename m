Ah, there we have it, Godwin's Law for software discussions.

What happens here is the following: the caller sets up an xdr_stream
that contains an array of NULL page pointers (__nfs4_proc_set_acl ->
nfs4_encode_acl -> xdr_init_encode_pages). It does so on purpose to
tell the XDR layer to allocate pages for it as needed, and it knows it
is responsible for later freeing those pages.

Without this patch, the XDR layer would immediately Oops when hitting
a NULL page pointer. This tells us that the XDR layer is so far not
prepared to handle NULL page pointers, and that we can assign a
meaning to NULL page pointers without affecting existing callers.

Using the existing XDR layer for XDR-encoding ACLs makes sense because
the XDR layer already knows how to align things, encode into multiple
pages, handle strings that wrap across pages, etc. I really don't want
to duplicate all that for ACLs.

Somebody unfamiliar with the existing code will not understand it
without putting some effort in, either. What do you expect? Besides,
the caller doesn't care where the allocation is happening, it just
cares that it is happening when it should.

You have pointed that out before, and as a consequence, it was fixed
in the July 22 snapshot (https://lwn.net/Articles/652058/):

    * Changes to the nfs patches: acls are now encoded above the sunrpc
      layer. This means we can no longer encode small acls directly into the
      scratch area of an xdr_buf, we always have to allocate extra memory.
      But we also don't need to touch the nfs sunrpc code, which Trond objected
      to.

Since then, the ACL encoding happens in __nfs4_proc_set_acl, before
calling into the RPC layer.

Thanks,
Andreas
