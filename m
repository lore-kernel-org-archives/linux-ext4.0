I also would prefer that we simply treat the time granularity as part
of the superblock (mounted volume) ie returned on fstat rather than on
every stat of the filesystem.   For cifs mounts we could conceivably
have different time granularity (1 or 2 second) on mounts to old
servers rather than 100 nanoseconds.
