I haven't given up on that, so yes, I'm still working on a more suitable
generic solution.
Background detection is one of the options, though it needs some more thoughts.
Giving up the sync approach means less accuracy for the threshold notifications,
but I guess this could be fine-tuned to get an acceptable level. Another bump:
how this tuning is supposed to be done (additional config option maybe)? 
The interface would have to keep it somehow sane - but what would 'sane' mean
in this case (?) Also, I'm not sure whether single approach would server here
well for all the potentially supported file systems so this would have to be
properly adjusted (taking the threshold levels into consideration as well). 
And still,it would require some form of synchronization with tracked fs so that
this 'detection' is not being unnecessarily performed (i.e. while fs remains frozen).

There is also an idea of using an interface resembling the stackable fs:
a transparent file system layered on top of the tracked one 
(solely for the tracking purposes). This would simplify handling the trace 
object's lifetime - no more list of registered traces.
It would also give a way of tracking (to some extent) the changes in the amount
of available space, which combined with tweaked background check could give
a solution with less performance overhead than the original one.
I'll try this one and see how it goes.

Thank You for your feedback so far - I really appreciate it.
