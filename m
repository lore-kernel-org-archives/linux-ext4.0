In the NFS case we do try to preserve filesystem boundaries as well as
we can--the protocol has an fsid field and the client creates a new
mount each time it sees it change.  And the protocol defines time_delta
as a per-filesystem attribute (though, somewhat hilariously, there's
also a per-filesystem "homogeneous" attribute that a server can clear to
indicate the per-filesystem attributes might actually vary within the
filesystem.)
