Thank you for discussing this with Ted.

This kind of problem is really tricky.

As server clusters get larger and larger, server maintenance becomes very
difficult. Therefore, timely detection of problems (i.e. online scanning,
similar to e2fsck -fn) and timely and non-stop fixing of problems (i.e.
online fsck, similar to e2fsck -a) have always been the requirements of
our customers. Thus online fsck has been on our TODO list, and it's really
time to start doing it. 😀

This solution looks great. If we save checksum further, we can sense not
only the change of block type, but also the change of block data.

But now journal_head takes up bh->b_private, so to record information,
we need to add new fields to buffer_head (e.g. b_info), or modify the logic
of journal_head (e.g. make bh->b_private hold ext4_bufdata, and include the
journal_head in ext4_bufdata. ocfs2 needs a similar adaptation).

The out-of-bounds access occurs here because the last dentry obtained
in ext4_xattr_set_entry() is not the same as the last dentry obtained
in ext4_xattr_block_find().

When we modify an xattr, we always hold the inode lock, so the ibody
case is not considered. Check_xattrs() is called to do a full check
when looking up an xattr, so it's not necessary to consider that either.

When inserting an xattr into an xattr block, there are three cases:

  * xattr block is newly allocated, and the block is allocated only
    after the entry is set in memory.
  * xattr block is unshared, insert the new xattr directly.
  * xattr block is shared, copy the xattr block and insert the new xattr.

Only in the last two cases can a multiply claimed xattr block result in
out-of-bounds access, so the buffer lock is held to verify that the data
is correct.
(It looks like kmemdup should be moved to the buffer lock here as well.🤔)

Thanks again!
