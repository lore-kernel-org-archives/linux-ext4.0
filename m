Things has gone a bit quiet thread wise ...
As I believe I've managed to snap back to reality, I was hoping we coul=
d continue with this?
I'm not sure if we've got everything cleared up or ... have we reached =
a dead end?
Please let me know if we can move to the next stage? Or, if there are a=
ny showstoppers?

Thank You,
