Orphan inodes (nlink == 0) have been forbidden from being linked back
into the ext3/4 filesystems as a means of dealing with a link/unlink
"race".

This patch effectively reverts 2988a7740dc0dd9a0cb56576e8fe1d777dff0db3

	"return ENOENT from ext3_link when racing with unlink"

which was discussed in the lkml thread:

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2007/1/12/200

The reverted commit was selected because disallowing relinking was just a
simpler solution -- not because removing tasks from the orphan list
was deemed difficult or incorrect.

Instead this patch utilizes the original patch proposed by Eric Sandeen.
Testing this patch with the orphan-repro.tar.bz2 code linked in that
thread seems to confirm that this patch does not reintroduce the OOPs.
Nonetheless, Amir Goldstein pointed out that if ext3_add_entry() fails
we'll also be left with a corrupted orphan list. So I've moved the orphan
removal code down to the spot where a successful return has been assured.

Eric's Original description (indented):

	Remove inode from the orphan list in ext3_link() if we might have
	raced with ext3_unlink(), which potentially put it on the list.
	If we're on the list with nlink > 0, we'll never get cleaned up
	properly and eventually may corrupt the list.

Unlike the reverted patch, this patch enables relinking an orphan inode
back into the filesystem. This relinking is extremely useful for
checkpoint/restart since it avoids incredibly costly and complex methods
of supporting checkpoint of tasks with open unlinked files. More on
how relink will be used can be found in the checkpoint/restart patches posted
with this patch.

Though relinking is a useful operation it may not be possible on all
filesystems. It appears to be possible in ext3/4 so this patch changes the
ext3/ext4 link functions to allow it and provide the .relink file operation
introduced earlier.

This assumes that in ext3/4 data written to unlinked files is not stored any
differently than data written to linked files. If that is not the case
I'd appreciate any pointers to the code showing where/how they are
handled differently. All I could find in ext3/4 was the orphan inode list.
