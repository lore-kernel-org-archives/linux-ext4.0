  I don't think overlay's workdir needs project id. Limits will be simply
checked when storing data into upperdir by overlayfs. Overlayfs will get
EDQUOT which it will report back into the user.

  So I don't know much about namespaces but I don't see how quota netlink
messages would be connected with *user* namespaces. But you are right that
quota netlink messages will contain ID of the violator mapped into init
user namespace so it won't make sense to processes in other user namespaces
even if they were able to receive it.

  Quota netlink messages are sent only in init_net namespace (since quota
netlink protocol wasn't made namespace aware). So this shouldn't be an
issue.

  Correct. This raises a somewhat unrelated question: Does this mean that a
container is able to mount arbitrary block device? Because also there we
just pass a device path to the kernel...

  Yes.

  Yes.

  Project ID in VFS quotas is fairly new thing. Once ext4 gains support for
it, I can add some documentation.

  I guess you need some coordination between namespaces? I only know that
traditionally xfsprogs use /etc/projid for name->project id translation 
and /etc/projects contain roots of directory trees for which you wish to
maintain directory quota together with project ids for each of the trees.
