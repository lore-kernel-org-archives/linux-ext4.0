  Me neither be someone will surely find something in future ;)

  Well, I would avoid defining anything that's not really used. So
currently you can define threshold events and we start with just those.
When someone hooks up filesystem error paths to send notification, we can
create event type for telling "filesystem corrupted". And so on... We just
have to be careful to document that new event types can be added and
userspace has to ignore events it does not understand.
