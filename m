This one is actually pretty interesting, though instead of exporting the i_flags directly (the S_* flags), it would be much better to export the FS_*_FL values.  The FS_*_FL values (e.g. FS_IMMUTABLE_FL) are already exposed to userspace via FS_IOC_{GET,SET}FLAGS and are stored on disk in ext2/3/4, so are guaranteed never to change.  The S_* flags DO in fact change between kernel releases.


Cheers, Andreas
