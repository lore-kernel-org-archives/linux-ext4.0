No, I don't think they will get confused.

The use of the flags is get/modify/set just like other flag setting
functions. The extsize and projid fields are condition on the
relevant flag being set on return from a get (i.e. projid is only
valid if XFS_XFLAG_PROJID[_INHERIT] is set), and those fields are
only considered valid on set if those flags are set by the
application (or remain set as a result of the getxattr).

Hence the applications that use the getxattr/setxattr interface
correctly shouldn't care what set of flags and values the filesystem
supports other than the specific flags the application needs the
filesystem to understand.

Yup, that's exactly what I meant by "conditionally use the padding".
Even if the padding was guaranteed to be zero, I'd strongly
recommend a flag bit to indicate the application understands that
the padding region has actual meaning to guard against buggy
applications.

Cheers,

Dave.
