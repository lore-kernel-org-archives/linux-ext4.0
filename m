We introduced QUEUE_FLAG_NOWAIT for devices which would not wait for
request completions. The ones which wait are MD devices because of sync
or suspend operations.

The only user of BLK_MQ_F_NONBLOCKING seems to be nbd. As you mentioned,
it uses the flag to offload it to a workqueue.

The other way to do it implicitly is to change the flag to
BLK_MAY_BLOCK_REQS and use it for devices which do wait such as md/dm.
Is that what you are hinting at? Or do you have something else in mind?
