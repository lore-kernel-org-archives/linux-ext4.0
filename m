That's better, yes. I agree with all your comments and I've changed
things accordingly.

Yes. The rcu_head doesn't need initializing or resetting though.

We won't need a base_acl_reinit() function for now.

Well, we would end up with &container_of() here which doesn't work and
doesn't make sense, either. Let me change acl_by_type to return a
base_acl ** to clean this up.

The get_acl and set_acl inode operations expect struct posix_acl to be declared.

Yes. I've added comments; there are also BUILD_BUG_ON() asserts in
posix_acl_release and richacl_put.

Ah, a little problem in how the patches are split. I've fixed it. This
code doesn't get pulled into the build because nothing requires
CONFIG_FS_RICHACL at that point; that's why I didn't notice.

Thanks,
Andreas
