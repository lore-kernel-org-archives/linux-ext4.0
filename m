This permission model is useful in mixed environments that involve
UNIX and Windows machines. Think of NAS boxes with Linux and Windows
clients, for example. It also fits the NFSv4 ACL model very well. If
you're not a user dealing with such environments, then the model
likely won't provide any benefits to *you*, and you're better off with
a less complicated permission model. That doesn't say anything about
other users, though.

The model is designed specifically to be compliant with the POSIX
permission model. What assumptions are you talking about?

I remember from past discussions that a permission model like the
POSIX ACL model that doesn't have DENY ACEs would be more to your
liking. This argument is dead from the start though: NFSv4 ACLs
without DENY ACEs cannot represent basic file permissions like 0604
where the owning group has fewer permissions than others, for example
(see the richaclex(7) man page). We would end up with a permission
model that isn't even compatible with the traditional POSIX file
permission model, one which nobody else implements or cares about.

Samba has been dealing with mapping between SIDs and UIDs/GIDs for a
long time, and it's working acceptably well.

We could store SIDs in ACEs, but that wouldn't make the actual
problems go away: Files on Linux have an owner and an owning group
which are identitifed by UID/GID, whereas a file is owned by a SID
which can be either a user or a group in a SID world. Also, processes
on Linux have an owner and a list of groups which are identified by
UID/GID, so any SIDs stored in filesystems would never match a
process, anyway.

(NFSv4 refers to users and groups as opposed to SIDs, and so it
doesn't have this problem.)

Thanks,
Andreas
