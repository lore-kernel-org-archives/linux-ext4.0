For either a read or a write we might have to read in the extent list
(note that for few enough extents they are stored in the inode and
we won't have to), in which case the call will block and by the
semantics you define we'll need to return -EAGAIN.

Btw, can you write a small blurb up for the man page to document these
ѕemantics in man-page like language?
