Yes but not in all cases: it's impossible to overcommit disk limits on 
project level without overcommiting on super-project level.
Hierarchical quotas can handle this [ hypothetically useful ] use case.

In this case project disk limits are almost useless and even dangerous 
because any unprivileged user could add files into limited project
witch belongs to other user.

But you have to search hardlinks everywhere (inode owner can hardlink it 
into any directory where he has write access because project can be 
changed temporary). And after that you have to search broken symlinks.
Also symlinks cannot share file between isolated containers which run in 
chroot while creating hardlinks is still possible but requires some
extra steps like changing project id or creating temporary directories
even if you're root.

Not so useful too. Probably that's the reason why this feature seems
never been implemented anywhere except xfs.

Could we change that? For example by adding flag into quota-info block
which makes project id more restrictive and useful?

As i see quota tools in xfsprogs checks file-system name and doesn't
work for anything except "xfs", so we have to patch it anywas.
xfstests are cool but I think fixing one ioctl isn't a problem.
Something else?
