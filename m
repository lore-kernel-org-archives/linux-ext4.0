Any reason why you just don't do uevents for the block devices today,
and not create a new type of netlink message and userspace tool required
to read these?

Always?

Always?  Even if the option is not selected?  Why is everyone forced to
always use this code?  Can't you disable it for the "tiny" systems that
don't need it?

Why not just use a 'struct kref' for your count, which will save a bunch
of open-coding of reference counting, and forcing us to audit your code
to verify you got all the corner cases correct?  :)

Are you properly reference counting this pointer?  I didn't see where
that was happening, so I must have missed it.
