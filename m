There is an optimization which ext4 has which will update related
timestamps when we write an inode table block, which is
"opportunistic", but there is no guarantee that this will happen.

This is purely optional; other file systems don't have to do this, but
it can be a win in that if related inodes are in the same 4k block,
and we need to update, say, the index file one because we are changing
i_size, but we were also doing non-allocating writes to the data file,
then we might as well write out the timestamps for the data file at
the same time, since this is "free".
