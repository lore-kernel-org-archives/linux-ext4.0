The filesystem interface now is the same as for POSIX ACLs, used by a
dozen or so filesystems already.

Any file system could choose a different on-disk format than the one
that ext4 currently uses, but I don't see a reason why any should.
Apart from uid / gid mappings that is the same as the user-space xattr
format. Network file systems like NFSv4 and CIFS with their predefined
over-the-wire formats obviously are another story.
