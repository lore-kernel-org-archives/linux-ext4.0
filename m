Sure, but the admin is going to notice those random numbers in the
next quota report they run and then a user is going to get
re-educated with a clue bat.

Not directly.  Project quotas have historically been used in tandem
with user quotas - user quotas cannot be escaped and that puts a
limit on the shenanigans that users can play with project quota.

[ Indeed, Irix only had user and project quotas - it *never* had group
quotas. e.g. when XFS was ported to Linux the project quota inode
was re-purposed for group quotas in 2001:

]

However, if you have a fileystem system that users can't directly
access (e.g. an NFS server) then you can use project quotas as a
space enforcement mechanism because users can't change the project
ID on the files on the server. We've used the same model with
containers - for the host to be able to use project quotas as space
resource controller, users inside a container must not be able to
change the project ID of a file....

Cheers,

Dave.
