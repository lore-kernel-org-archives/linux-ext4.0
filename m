I think I must be missing something simple here.  In a hypothetical
world where the code used nsown_capable, if an admin wants to stick a
container in /mnt/container1 with associated prid 1 and a userns,
shouldn't it just map only prid 1 into the user ns?  Then a user in
that userns can't try to change the prid of a file to 2 because the
number "2" is unmapped for that user and translation will fail.
