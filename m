  Well, the VFS quota API is trivially extended by adding additional quota
type so I don't really see about which reinventing of quota API are you
speaking here...

  Well, quota-tools will have to extended to know about the new quota type.
Yes. But that's easy to do. I think teaching xfs quota tools to work with
ext4 will be a bigger project plus I don't think I want to force sysadmins
which are used to work with quota-tools to switch to other utilities just
because of project quotas.

Regarding xfstests - I've checked and most of the project quota tests in
xfs directory aren't directly usable for ext4 anyway because of other
functionality ext4 doesn't support. So we'll need to distill the least
common denominator from them anyway...

  Yeah, this should all be easy.
