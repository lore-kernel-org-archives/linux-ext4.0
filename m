I saw your patch to that effect.  I'm of mixed feelings about this, since the S_* flags have traditionally been changed on an ad-hoc basis and I don't necessarily want to let this leak into the on-disk format of these flags for ext*.

One way to ensure that this holds true is to have a compile-time assertion that the respective S_* flags match FS_*_FL and EXT_*_FL.

We use a macro in Lustre for compile-time assertions that depends on the detection of duplicate values in a switch() statement:

/** Compile-time assertion.
* Check an invariant described by a constant expression at compile time by
* forcing a compiler error if it does not hold.  @cond must be a constant
* expression as defined by the ISO C Standard:
*
*       6.8.4.2  The switch statement
*       ....
*       [#3] The expression of each case label shall be  an  integer
*       constant   expression  and  no  two  of  the  case  constant
*       expressions in the same switch statement shall have the same
*       value after conversion...
*
*/
#define CLASSERT(cond) do {switch(42) {case (cond): case 0: break;}} while (0)

I wouldn't object to that.  The BSD flags indicate that the hidden bit should only affect GUI display managers, not "ls".

Hmm, good question.

If they aren't requested by userspace, the cost is mostly irrelevant.  I think on OSX these flags are returned for every "ls" call, to mark the inodes with xattrs every time.
