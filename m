Sorry about that. Since we are implementing a feature which exsits in X=

for years, your opions are surely very important. They are not ignored.
But I think more discussion is necessary before an common agreement is

OK. That is another semantics which needs further discussion whether
we need to implement for Ext4. Container space management is one
of the project quota use case. I am not sure how widely used it is,
but I like features with less limits.

OK. I am fine with general ioctl to set/get project ID.

I don't think difficulty is a big problem. I'm wondering whether it is
necessary.

Well, I am not so familar with XFS, so I might be all wrong about
XFS. But honestly, a lot of quota interfaces of XFS seems not
so standard. For example, all the Q_X* flags used in do_quotactl().
Maybe there are really good reasons why they are there. I don't
know. And XFS does not use general codes under fs/quota. That
is a big difference with Ext4.

I am afraid I have to make existing tools project quota aware. And
actually I've done most of the work. I've updated e2fsprogs and
quota-tools to support project quota. Unfortunately these updates are
inevitable anyway. As Jan Kara said, we can't force system admins
to change from quota-tool command to xfs quota tools. Thus, I add
'-P $PROJECT' arguments to all the commands. And based on
those tools, I made a script which is less than 1K lines for
regression test. It is working pretty well. I don't see a good reason
why it is necessary to change everything to XFS way.

Sorry about my ignorance about the existing usage of XFS
project quota. I hope it is widely used. But does it really matters
for XFS that what kind of Ext4 interfaces is going to use?
Existing appplications would run happily on XFS any way
using the exisitng XFS interfaces. And if you are concerning
about the compatibility between Ext4 and XFS, I am afraid
those applications have to be changed any way when been ported
to Ext4. Since those applications are using XFS specific feature,
i.e. project quota, it is likely they are using other kind of XFS
speicific features which probably will never be implemented on
Ext4. I don't think there is any easy way to port them from
XFS to Ext4 any way. And I really don't think therea are many
such kind of applications. So, since we are not implementing
interfaces for XFS2 or XFS3, I don't think compatibility problem
is so critical.
