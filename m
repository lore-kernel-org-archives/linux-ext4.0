I mean hierarchy allows to group several projects into one super-project
which sums all disk usage and could have its own limit too.

Some people run inside containers complete distributives with multiple
services or even nested virtualization.

I've poked this code and played with some use-cases.
Hierarchical project quotas are cool and it seems the only option for
virtualization and providing seamless nested project quotas inside
containers. But, right now I'm not so interested in this feature.
Let's leave this for the future.


For now I'm more interested in participation disk space among services
in one system. As I see security model of project quota in XFS almost
non-existent for this case: it forbids linking/renaming files between
different projects but any unprivileged user might change project id
for its own files. That's strange, this operation should be privileged.

Also if user have permission for changing project id he could be
permitted to link and rename file into directory with any project id, 
because he anyway could change project, move, and revert it back.


For me perfect interface looks like couple fcntls for getting/changing 
project id:

int fcntl(fd, F_GET_PROJECT, projid_t *);
int fcntl(fd, F_SET_PROJECT, projid_t);

F_GET_PROJECT is allowed for everybody
F_SET_PROJECT requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN (or maybe CAP_FOWNER?)
(for virtualization id also must be mapped in user-ns)

ioctl XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR should stay xfs specific.
And XFS_DIFLAG_PROJINHERIT should stay XFS-only feature too.
I don't see any use cases for that flag. For files is has no effect
for directories it's mostly equal to setting directory project id
to zero. The only difference in accounting directory itself.

Cross-project renaming/linking must be allowed if user have
permissions for changing project id at file and directory.
This is useful for sharing files between containers.
