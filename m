Something like this:

	#if S_SYNC != FS_SYNC_FL               ||      \
	       S_IMMUTABLE != FS_IMMUTABLE_FL  ||      \
	       S_APPEND != FS_APPEND_FL        ||      \
	       S_NOATIME != FS_NOATIME_FL      ||      \
	       S_DIRSYNC != FS_DIRSYNC_FL
	#error Ext2/3/4 assumes these equivalences
	#endif

would do the trick.

I suppose.  I was thinking that they may have to be retrieved from the server.

More concerning to me is the effect of adding more fields to the kstat struct.

Nonetheless, having these flags around may be useful to CIFS, Samba, NFS and
NFSD as various of them may appear in those protocols.  Certainly, SMB passes
a bit indicating compression around (ATTR_COMPRESSED).
