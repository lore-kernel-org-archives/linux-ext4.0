Yes, I said as much: "... it should not matter whether we use
xfs_quota or the generic quotatool ....". I've been saying that tool
compability is an absolute requirement for the ext4 project quota
implementation from the very start - I'm not about to say it doesn't
matter now.

Yes, eventually we need to have tests for the generic quotatool,
but only having generic quotatool tests run only on ext4 does not
prove anything about the compatibility of the new ext4 kernel code
with the pre-existing quota tools and kernel APIs.

The first step is not "duplicate all the tests with different
infrastructure as new one-filesystem-only specific tests".  We need
to ensure the APIs are compatible *before merging the kernel code*,
and these tests do no do that.

IOWs, like all the other tests we've made generic for kernel
functionality we've moved from XFS to generic code, the steps are:

	1. move the tests from tests/xfs to tests/generic
	2. make the xfs specific utilities work on non XFS
	   filesystems and, if necessary, use the new generic kernel
	   API.
	3. make the tests also run and passwork on non-XFS filesystems

	[ at this point we can say the new ext4 kernel code is good to
	  commit ]

	4. factor the generic tests so that the test core is
	   independent of the infrastructure that needs testing
	5. Duplicate the generic tests *as generic tests* using the
	   different tools that need testing /or/ make the
	   tooling selectable by environment/config file
	   variables.

After step 5, we should have tests that run on multiple filesystems
using multiple tools, and they all give the same results. The tests
as proposed don't provide us with any guarantee that the generic
quota tool will work on XFS, nor that ext4 has an API that is
compatible with XFS.

Cheers,

Dave.
