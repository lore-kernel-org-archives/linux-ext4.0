AFAICS, OpenVZ has self-released quota tools to supply this feature.

You means the directly/project quota on ext4?
If yes, I have observed this feature back to the end of last year in
EXT4 mail list.

It simply cached at memory for now, it also can be tweak up to journaled
I think, if introducing corresponding routines quota_read/quota_write to
particular journal file system.

There have such requirements dropped to LXC mail list nowadays.
Directory quota is pretty cool and it also useful to containers perspective.

However, that's two different quota mechanism.

"Quota code doesn't scale well".
Do you means it have global locking mechanism and only quota structure
to bill up quota for all file systems with VFS quota enabled?

I noticed that OpenVZ has introduced an image file to supply container
quota, and especially for the container migration consideration.
However, could it be a general solution to LXC?
