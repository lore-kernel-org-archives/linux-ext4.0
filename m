The basic idea of generation numbers is to check if an inode was 
recycled, so only if the tuple of inode-number and generation-number 
matches we still have the same file. Kernel nfs uses that and unfs3 uses 
it via EXT2_IOC_GETVERSION, which has the overhead of an additional 
syscall. Unionfs-fuse usually keeps file open, however, it might run out 
of the maximum allowed files and I plan to add a mode to close and 
re-open files as failback mode. For that the definite knowledge if a 
file/inode is still the very same and the inode was not just recycled is 
crucial.

All of that being said, I think with open_by_handle_at() syscall we 
don't need the inode generation number any more.

Bernd
