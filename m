  Do you mean full get/setfsxattr API? That basically contains project ID,
flags (those that are currently get/set with FS_IOC_GETFLAGS/SETFLAGS), and
extent size hint right? That seems workable and it would also make setting
of PROJINHERIT flag fs agnostic. Only we would have to create some generic
flags namespace and merge into that ext4 flags and have a translation
function for the old ext4 flags. Also I'm afraid we may quickly run out of
32 available flags in xflags so we'd need to extend that. But all this
seems to be doable.
