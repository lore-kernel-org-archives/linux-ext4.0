Actually, XFS uses the inode number to encode the location of the
inode (it doesn't have a fixed inode table, so it's effectively the
block number shifted left by 3 or 4 bits, with the low bits indicating
the slot in the 4k block).  It has a hack to provide backwards
compatibility for 32-bit API's, but there is a similar, "oh, we're on
a non-paleolithic CPU, let's use the full 64-bits" sort of logic that
ext4 has.

Are there going to be cases where a process or a thread will sometimes
want the 64-bit interface, and sometimes want the 32-bit interface?
Or is it always going to be one or the other?  I wonder if we could
simply add a new flag to the process personality(2) flags.

Yeah, that seems dubious because I'm pretty sure there are other file
systems that may have their own 32/64-bit quirks.
