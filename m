We could be on a multi-user system, and the user mounting the
filesystem may not be the only user on the system. When a filesystem
can be mounted read-only, it should be safe to use read-only. It is
not safe in general to use such a filesystem read-only, so an
incompatible feature flag which prevents such unsafe mounting is more
approporiate than a read-only incompatible feature flag.

Mounting a filesystem read-only doesn't mean that the filesystem is
being recovered, it is perfectly legal to mount a filesystem read-only
for other reasons. I don't want to give people using read-only
filesystems the false sense that everything is okay.

Indeed. It will also make it less likely for users to accidentally
shoot themselves in the foot. If someone knows better, they can clear
the feature flag.

When recovering a broken system that contains richacl filesystems, you
really want to have richacl support in the rescue system as well.
Otherwise, you won't be able to fsck those filesystems.

That's all completely beside the point. I'm not talking about
preventing attacks at all, just basic administrative workflows.
