  GETQUOTA or SETQUOTA quotactls should work just fine inside a container
(for those quota-tools just need access to /proc/mounts). QUOTAON should
also work for e.g. XFS or ext4 with hidden quota files. When quota files
are visible in fs namespace (as for ext3 or so), things would be a bit
tricky because they won't be possibly visible from container and QUOTAON
needs that.

Also with QUOTAON there is the principial problem that quotas either are or
are not enabled for the whole filesystem. So probably the only reasonable
choice when you would like to supporot quotas in the container would be to
have quotas enabled all the time, and inside the container, you would just
set some quota limits or you won't...
