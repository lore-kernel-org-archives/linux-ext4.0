  Here we still don't have resolved the problem that inode number 11 may be
used. Please note that in the changelog as FIXME so that we don't forget.

  I'm ok with the fact that you removed support for project quota files not
in system files. However why do you keep the PRJJQUOTA mount option then?
Quota tools are clever enough to query kernel for enabled quota without
checking for mount options these days. So they don't need the mount option
for anything. And kernel doesn't need the option for anything either
(usrquota and grpquota mount options are there only for quota in standard
files case).
