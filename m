OK.  So we'll define a 'force' flag at some point in the future.  Got it.

Uhhh.  So what are the semantics of len?  That is, on SET, what does
a filesystem do if userspace says "Here's 8 bytes" but the filesystem
usually uses 16 bytes?  What does the same filesystem do if userspace
offers it 32 bytes?  If the answer is "returns -EINVAL", how does
userspace discover what size of volume ID is acceptable to a particular
filesystem?

And then, on GET, does 'len' just mean "here's the length of the buffer,
put however much will fit into it"?  Should filesystems update it to
inform userspace how much was transferred?

I think there was mention of a manpage earlier.  And if this is truly
for "volume ID" instead of "UUID", then lets call it "volume ID" and
not "UUID" to prevent confusion.
