Rewrite the preceding two paras in a better logical split and order:

[[
RichACLs can be enabled on supported local filesystems (currently, ext4=
 and
XFS).  The in-kernel NFSv4 server and client also include RichACL suppo=
rt.

Enabling RichACLs disables POSIX Access Control Lists;
the two ACL models cannot coexist on the same filesystem.

(I think) I know what you are trying to say in the previous paragraph,
but "this approach" and "directly modifying the ACL entries" is a littl=
e
vague.  Masks are about solving the hysteresis problem, right? So, how
about some text along the following lines (I'm sure you can improve):

[[
The purpose of the file masks is to allow applications that are unaware
of RichACLs to place limits on the permissions granted by various
classes of RichACL in a manner that corresponds to the traditional
user/group/other semantics, without modifying the ACL entries in those
classes.  Without the file masks, the only alternative would be for the
kernel to directly modify the ACL entries in those classes. However,
this latter approach could have a "hysteresis effect", whereby
a RichACL-unaware application that performs a transition from one file
mode to another file mode and then back to the original file mode
could cause destruction of the permission information in ACL entries.

I'd be inclined to use (or add) \fBACL_OTHER\fP instead of "other"
in the preceding line.  Things makes things IMO a little clearer when
you try to distinguish from "other" file permissions.

The preceding sentence immediately triggers an obvious question for the
reader.  So, do we need a sentence here to say when/where the "defaulte=

flag is set?

Why "should be" in the previous sentence? I think a little explanation
is needed here...

So, I think a sentence explaining why "read_acl" exists would be
helpful, since the reader is left a little puzzled about its purpose if
it is always implicitly granted.

So, in the above subcases, the following does not seem to be covered:
        (1) "masked" ACL flag is set AND
        (2) requesting process *is* in owning group *or* an ACL other
            than "everyone@"matches the process.

What happens in this case? I suspect that somehow we are supposed to
fall through to part "b)" below (and possibly into clause "2."?), but
the logical structure of the clauses does not reflect this.

At some point, perhaps in the next paragraph, I think that it needs to
be clarified that unlike POSIX ACLs, a process can gain the permissions
it requires by accumulating them from multiple RichACL enties. (That's
correct, is it not?)

So, perhaps replace the preceding two lines with something like:

[[
Upon reaching this point, the determination of whether or not access is
granted is made by scanning all ACL entries to see if one or more
applicable entries together grant a cumulative set of permissions that
matches the requested permissions or there is an applicable entry that
explicitly denies one or more of the requested permissions.
The scan of all ACL entries begins by
first initializing the set of remaining permissions (i.e., those that h=
ave
not yet been satisfied during the scan) to be the set of requested
permissions. Then the ACL entries are scanned
=2EIR "in order" ,
and for each entry:

The meaing of "will stay the same" is not quite clear "will stay the
same *as what*"?). I suspect I know what you mean, but it needs to be
made more obvious.

I'm going to play the broken record :-)

Could we start with just a few simple examples already, and build up
over future iterations of this page?

Move this entry to the point XXX below.

By the way, are there already man pages for the librichacl functions?
