So the intended semantics is:
1) fsync / sync / freeze / unmount will write the timestamp updates even
   with lazytime. So unless crash happens, timestamps are guaranteed to be
   consistent. Also sync / fsync guarantees all changes to get to disk.
2) We periodically write back timestamps (once per 24 hours) to avoid too
   big timestamp inconsistencies in case of crash.

Otherwise there are no guarantees wrt durability. I've CCed Ted who
designed this just in case I missed something.
