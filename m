I'm not sure we are on the same page here.
This is about watching the file system rather than the 'real' device.
Like the threshold notifications: you would like to know when you
will be approaching certain level of available space for the tmpfs
mounted on /tmp.  You do know you are watching the /tmp
and you know that the dev numbers for this are 0:20 (or so). 
(either through calling stat on /tmp or through reading the /proc/$$/mountinfo)
With this interface you can setup threshold levels
for /tmp. Then, once the limit is reached the event will be
sent with those anonymous major:minor numbers.

I can provide a sample code which will demonstrate how this
can be achieved.

I was referring to btrfs here as a filesystem with multiple devices
and its btrfs device scan :)

I was referring here to the mounts visibility and the mount propagation
which on some distros is set by default with the make-shared option,
so the mounts created in new namespace are visible outside of it (running
cat /proc/$$/moutinfo showed the new mounts). Which got me really
confused, obviously.

It will/is indeed - still I believe it's worth giving it a try.
I'll try to work out the namespace issue here and get back to you.
