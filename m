No.  The contents of xstat_parameters aren't changed.  request_mask is =
what
you're asking for, result_mask in the xstat struct is what you actually=

result_mask may be more or less than request_mask as the filesystem isn=

something you did ask for, and may give you stuff anyway that you didn'=

Yep.  I forgot to change that in the patch description.

I suppose.

That's reasonable.
