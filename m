I'd be more than happy to extend the scope of suggested changes.
I hope I'll be able to collect more comments - in this way there 
is a chance we might get here smth that is really useful, for everyone.

I've tried to make the interface rather flexible, so that new cases
can be easily added - so the notification whenever a file system
is being mounted is definitely doable.

The vfs here merely serves the purpose to configure which type of events
and for which filesystems are to be issued. Having this done through
netlink is also an option, though it needs some more thoughts. The way
notifications are being sent might be extended: so there could be more
than one option for this. We might also want to consider if we want to
have this widely available - everything for everyone. (?)

As for the rest, I must admit I'm not really an fs person, so I assume
there will be more comments and questions like yours. This is also why
any comments/hints/remarks/doubts/issues etc would me more than just
welcomed. I'll try to answer them all, though this will require some
time on my side, thus apologies if I have some delays.


I'll get beck to this asap.
