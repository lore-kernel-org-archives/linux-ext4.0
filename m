  Sorry, I don't understand. Quota structures are cached in memory. Also
what would be simpler if you also do some caching in a container?

  Yes, quotacheck inside a container is a problem. But similarly as with
quotaon(8), I think such global operation should rather be done outside.

  Yes, that would be my suggestion.
