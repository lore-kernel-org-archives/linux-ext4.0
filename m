So that's fixed now in nfs-utils and the latest richacl snapshot.

It turns out that when setting an ACL, the ACL can contain UID/GID
numbers as well as user@domain strings which the server cannot map.
The status code is NFS4ERR_BADNAME both when the server doesn't
support UID/GID numbers and when it cannot map a name, so in that
case, we cannot tell the difference.

Luckily, when a UID/GID cannot be mapped to a name, nfs falls back to
sending the server a UID/GID number instead even when
NFS_CAP_UIDGID_NOMAP has been cleared. So unprivileged users can turn
on the idmapper, but at least that doesn't break unmapped UIDs/GIDs.
(I got that wrong in my initial analysis.)

Thanks,
Andreas
