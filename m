Right, sorry, that's just the NFS word for the same thing.

So my whine here is just that most callers only want to know one number
and we're giving them three.  Whatever, they can just pick one.  It
feels a little ugly, but feel free to ignore my nitpicking....

(Though as Steve French asked: could we add this to statfs (or something
similar) instead?)

Yep, agreed, the granularity should be what the filesystem can store, we
should just make sure that statement makes it into any eventual man
pages or other documentation, since it does seem to surprise people.
