You have me convinced about removing CONFIG_XFS_RICHACL.

As a read-only compat flag, kernels that cannot enforce richacls would
still be able to mount richacl file systems read-only. That's a
problem when acls are used to forbid read/execute access.

Right, I shouldn't have used the term atomic. It's one inode operation
under i_mutex, and the filesystem can pack it into one transaction.
