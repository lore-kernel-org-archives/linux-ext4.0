"hint" seems like this isn't really going to work well.

Do you have userspace code that can properly map this back to the "real"
device that is causing problems?  Without that, this doesn't seem all
that useful as no one would be able to use those events.

You can't run a scanning tool on a tmpfs :)

So what can a user do with information about one of these "virtual"
filesystems that it can't directly see or access?

What is "root level" here?  You can mount things in different namespaces
all over the place.

This is going to get really complex very quickly :(

I still think you should tie this to an existing sysfs device, which
handles the namespace issues for you, and it also handles the fact that
userspace can properly identify the device, if at all possible.
