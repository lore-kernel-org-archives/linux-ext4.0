Yes, when a user doesn't exist, idmapper maps that to the nobody
uid/gid. That's the failure mode of stat. In the acl case, we do want
to map user and group names to their respective ids where possible (so
that the acl makes sense in the local system context), but we do want
to preserve the original user and group names when there is no such
mapping instead of mapping to the nobody uid/gid.

Yes, I believe that would be enough.

The bug can be triggered by unprivileged users with nfs4_setfacl.

Thanks,
