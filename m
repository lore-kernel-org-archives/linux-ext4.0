How would this work?  We already have the separate
COMPAT_DEFINE_SYSCALL entries *and* in_compat_syscall(). Now we=E2=80=99d h=
ave
a third degree of freedom.

Either the arches people care about should add reasonable ways to
issue 32-bit syscalls from 64-bit mode or there should be an explicit
way to ask for the 32-bit directory offsets.
