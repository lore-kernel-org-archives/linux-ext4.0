The project quota support in the generic quota tool should work XFS
as well as ext4. If it doesn't, then it's not a generic tool, right?
The whole point of having ext4 use the same userspace API as XFS is
so that all quotas can be managed with the one tool. Essentially, if
ext4 project quotas cannot be controlled by xfs_quota, then the ext4
code is not compatible with XFS and hence still needs work.

FWIW, if ext4 has implemented the kernel project quota interfaces
correctly, then it should not matter whether we use xfs_quota or the
generic quotatool because the kernel will translate the filesystem
information to whatever format the quota was requested in...

So, you should be able to simply use the xfs_quota tool in the tests
you make generic without needing any significant modification to the
tests to run them on ext4. Yes, that may mean you need to send a 5
line patch to make xfs_quota run on ext4, but that's trivial
compared to duplicating >10 tests and then having to maintain them
forever...

Cheers,

Dave.
