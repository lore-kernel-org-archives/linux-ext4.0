Hi Dave,

I was mostly working on the semantics of inherit flag on these patches.=
 And
I didn=A1=AFt realized that the interface differences would bother you =
so much. Sorry
for that.

I agree that we should choose a good interface. It would be good that i=
t is
general so that it works well for all file systems. I agree that adding=
 an
ext4 specific ioctl() is far from the best choice. I am willing to chan=
ge it to
any general interface. A general ioctl() sounds good to me. Extend seta=
ttr()
and getattr() for project ID sounds even better, since project ID looks=
 like
UID/GID. And general xattr name is another choice. But it is might be a=
 little
bit confusing if we use xattr actually, since we are not saving project=
 ID as
extended attribute on Ext4. Any choice is fine with me, as long as the
implementation won't introduce nasty codes or inconsistent design.

However, the problem is, I do not quite understand why we should keep
the interface exactly the same with XFS. It would be good if we can. Bu=
t
as far as I can see, it seems hard. XFS uses a lot interfaces which are
not so standard and used by other file systems. For example, struct
fsxattr is not used by other file systems at all except XFS. I am not s=
ure
why we should introduce this into Ext4 if there are a lot of other bett=
er
ways. I would be happy to change to XFS interfaces, if it is general.
However, I don=A1=AFt think it is general enough.

I know xfstest is using the existing project quota interfaces of XFS. A=
nd
maybe there are some applications which are using them too. But
keeping the interfaces exactly the same with XFS would cost so much
effort that I=A1=AFd like to get enough reasons before start working on=
 it. Is it
really necessary? I am not so sure. It is so easy to change user
space applications comparing to changing a weird interfaces. For
example, I think it won=A1=AFt cost even more than a day to add xfstest
support for new Ext4 project quota. And since project quota is far from
a widely used feature, I don=A1=AFt think there is much compatibility p=
roblems
for existing applications.  And If the new project interface are genera=
l
enough, there won=A1=AFt be any compatibility problems for new applicat=
ions
at all.

I might missed something important. So please let me know if you have
any advices.
