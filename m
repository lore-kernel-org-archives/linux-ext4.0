XFS used to do that, too, before we removed all that hackery when we
moved to logging timestamp updates unconditionally a few years ago.
I'm going to have to re-instate some of that code for lazytime, I
think.

*nod*. Explicit, optimised clustered inode writeback (rather than
purely opportunistic clustering via delayed buffer writeback) was
added to XFS way back in early 1999. :)

Cheers,
