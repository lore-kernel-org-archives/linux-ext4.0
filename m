I haven't looked at the current nfsidmap interface....  So it's
completely lacking any way to communicate failure?

Is it enough to turn off the failover in the case there's no possibilit=
y
it could have been caused by a numeric id?

If any user can set ACLs with arbitrary strings as names, then we'd be
giving any user unprivileged user the ability to turn off numeric
idmapping, so I think we need to fix that.
