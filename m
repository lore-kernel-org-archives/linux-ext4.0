We have Orangefs users who have applications they
can't run because the applications open with
O_DIRECT. They are happy when I show them
how to "pretend" to support O_DIRECT - the
way they did it in NFS back in the 2.6 era...

I was thinking of adding it to the upstream version,
maybe as a mount option... so I like this "hint" idea...
