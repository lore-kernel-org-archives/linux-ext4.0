I think we should support both and leave the decision on what
is to be reported or not to particular file systems keeping it
to a reasonable extent, of course. The interface should hand it over
to user space - acting as a go-between. I would though avoid
any filesystem specific events (when it comes to specifying those),
keeping it as generic as possible.
