It needs to be done internally by the app but is doable.
The app knows what it is watching, so it can maintain the mappings.
So prior to activating the notifications it can call 'stat' on the mount point.
Stat struct gives the 'st_dev' which is the device id. Same will be reported
within the message payload (through major:minor numbers). So having this,
the app is able to get any other information it needs. 
Note that the events refer to the file system as a whole and they may not
necessarily have anything to do with the actual block device.
