I'm not sure what you mean by a stable vs a volatile inode number.

NTFS: Not at all.

FAT: The hidden bit causes the filename to get a dot prepended (and nothing
else is noted).

Yep.  I wasn't going to do more filesystems till we'd finished arguing about
the basic arrangement of things in struct xstat.

HSM?

Hmmm...  Interesting question.  Both NTFS and CIFS have an offline attribute
(which is where I originally got this from) - but should I have a separate
indicator to indicate the client can't access a server over a network
(ie. we've gone to disconnected operation on this file)?  E.g. should there be
a XSTAT_INFO_DISCONNECTED too?
