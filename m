Yeah, "synchronize" is something only Windows clients care about, as I
understand it.  The others are for NFS features that nobody has tried to
implement yet.  It's useful to store those bits but they don't do
anything at this point.  We could provie FC references, I guess, but
it's probably not worth going into much detail about.

Yeah, the "automatic" name is probably misleading, but I think we're
stuck with that name and just need to make the point a bit more
forcefully.

Userland utilities take responsibility for the actual recursive
propagation of changes, all the kernel does is provide a few bits which
help to do it correctly (e.g. to distinguish between ACEs that ewre
inherited inherited (and can be blown away by propagation) and those
that were added locally).
