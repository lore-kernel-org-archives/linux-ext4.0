  Well, most apps will access the root file system regardless of what we
send over netlink... So I don't see netlink events improving the situation
there too much. You could try to use it for something like failover but
even there I'm not too convinced - just doing some IO, waiting for timeout,
and failing over if IO doesn't complete works just fine for that these
days. That's why I was asking because I didn't see convincing usecase
myself...
