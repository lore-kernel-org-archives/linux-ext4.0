that's great.

I'll take a look at the patches.

I dislike the use of "lxc" name. There is nothing lxc-specific in this, 
this is namespace-specific. lxc is just one of the container solutions 
out there, so let's keep it generic.

It's a system call. It is always called by a process. The process 
belongs to a namespace. What else is needed?

I still don't understand what is the business of cgroups here. If you 
are attaching it to mount namespace, you can always infer the context 
from the calling process. I still need to look at your patches, but I 
believe that dropping the "feature" of manipulating this from outside of 
the container will save you a lot of trouble.

Please note that a process can temporarily join a namespace with 
setns(). So you can have a *utility* that does it from the outer world, 
but the kernel has no business with that. As far as we're concerned, I 
believe that you should always get your context from the current 
namespace, and forbid any usage from outside.

No, this should be transferred to the process-specific proc and them 
symlinked. Take a look at "/proc/self".

I didn't read your patches yet, so take it with a grain of salt here. 
But I don't understand why you make this distinction of keeping it in 
memory only.

You could keep quota files outside of the container, and then bind mount 
them to the current location in the setup-phase.
