The main issue here is "let's bail out from ->write_iter() instances"
patch.  It very obviously has holes in coverage.

Could we have FMODE_AIO_NOWAIT and make those who claim to support it
set that in ->open()?  And make aio check that and bail out if asked
for nowait on a file without that flag...
