Well, I didn't say that :) In summary, an application needs to try to 
use the open-by-handle call and if that is not supported, it has to fall 
back to traditional stat and generation-number-ioctl. And as I said 
before, open-by-handle very likely removes the requirement for 
generation numbers in sys_statxat().
