It we can reach a consensus to bind quota on mount namespace for
container or other things maybe.
I think it definitely should depends on user namespace.

Is it also an implications that we can examine do container quota or not
based on the uid/gid number?

Do you means that we can not bind mount outside files to container for
as general adquot.user/adquot.group purpose?

If so, per glauber's comments, bind quota to mount namespace should be a
generic feature, and container just one of users could make use of it.

Again, if bind quota to mount namespace is on right direction, and it
only does make sense to container for now, maybe we don't need such
files. IMHO, container is a lightweight virtualization solution, maybe
its fine to make it as simple as possible.  If the server admin need to
configure hundreds of user/group dquot per container, perhaps he should
consider KVM/XEN.


Thanks,
