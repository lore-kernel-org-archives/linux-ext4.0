That's an utter nightmare to manage - just ask the gluster guys who
thought this was a good idea when they first implemented quotas.

Besides, following down the path of heirarchical control groups
doesn't seem like a good idea to me because that path has already
proven to be a bad idea for container resource controllers. There's
good reason why control groups have gone back to a flattened ID
space like we already have for project quotas, so I don't think we
want to go that way.

I don't follow. project ID is exactly what allows you to control
project classification.

It's not the mapping that matters - if project quotas are used
outside containers as a resource controller, then they can't be
used inside containers even with a unique mapping range because
we can only store a single project ID per inode.

Besides, I'm struggling to see the use case for project quotas
inside small containers that run single applications and typically
only have a single user. Project quotas have traditionally been used
to manage space in large filesystems shared by many users along
bounds that don't follow any specific heirarchy or permission set.

IOWs, you haven't described your use case for needing project quotas
inside containers, so I've got no idea what problem you are trying
to solve or whether project quotas are even appropriate as a
solution.

So you are proposing a fourth on-disk quota here i.e.  user, group,
project, new_2nd_level_project? If so, forget about using systemd to
manage it, the first thing we'll need is need full support in
existing quota tools so that the regression tests you write for
xfstests are self contained.

You really need to post a use case description and  adesign document
for review so we can actually discuss what you are planning. So far
everything you are doing strikes me as a "because they are there and
it sounds cool" type of development, not because people actually
need them. Let's have a discussion about the real problems and
architecture, not waste time on a stupid "solution looking for a
problem" discussion...

Cheers,

Dave.
