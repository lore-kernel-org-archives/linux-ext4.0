I am not sure if it is right to penalize the application to write to
file which has been freshly opened (and is the first one to open). It
basically means extent maps needs to be read from disk. Do you see a
reason it would have a non-deterministic wait if it is the only user? I
understand the block layer can block if it has too many requests though.
