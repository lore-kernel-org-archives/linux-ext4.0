Noted, thanks.

You're right, I misread it, it references the init network namespace
and not the user namespace:

fs/quota/netlink.c:quota_send_warning() uses genlmsg_multicast() which
specifically references init_net:

         return genlmsg_multicast_netns(family, &init_net, skb,
                                        portid, group, flags);

The process would still need CAP_SYS_ADMIN and there are additional
checks when the user namespace is not the initial user namespace:

fs/namespace.c do_new_mount()
        if (user_ns != &init_user_ns) {
                if (!(type->fs_flags & FS_USERNS_MOUNT)) {
                        put_filesystem(type);
                        return -EPERM;
                }...

For example, FS_USERNS_MOUNT is set on devpts_fs_type but not on
ext4_fs_type. So it's not possible to mount ext4 in a different user
namespace. Containers that don't use user namespaces can avoid giving
CAP_SYS_ADMIN or restrict mount with some AppArmor rules.

Yes, I was thinking if Docker uses projid for some containers, rkt
uses other projid for other containers and the sysadmin also define
some projid manually.

Thanks for the pointer.
